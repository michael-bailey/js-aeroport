# Aeroport Demo

---

this is a project used to test and create objects in javascript based on the idea of representing an aeroport.

## Thoughts

much of this i found familiar from other languages like python and java, especially with functions, varables and classes. 

However when it came to asynchronous programming it took some time to fully grasp how everything fit together. For example, the callback methods of the fs module i found jarring and very difficult to read due to calling callbacks in other callbacks

Due to this the Promise method was much easier to understand but when used in conjuntion with the fs module again, it followed the same confusion, this was slightly helped with the async await method.

After i had other examples of the async await and promise methods i found them quite intuitive and usefull later on.
